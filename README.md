Abstract
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The global trends of digitalization, intelligentization, and vehicle electrification are increasing our reliance on electrical energy, which poses unprecedented challenges to the stability of power-grid networks. When power generation or transmission capacity fails to meet the surging power demand, power grids can experience a precipitous voltage decline---a severe system instability known as voltage collapse---potentially leading to large-scale blackouts. Yet, currently, only limited understanding exists about the network structural factors contributing to voltage collapse. By systematically probing all load nodes under increasing power demand in the North American power grid and 30 additional power systems, we show that the threshold of voltage collapse is mainly determined by a simple network parameter, namely an effective distance defined by the admittance matrix. Our analysis reveals that the network's vulnerability stems not from overall capacity constraints but rather from inadequate capacity on certain critical components explicitly identified by the effective distance. This finding and the dimension reduction that comes with it can be used to identify vulnerable components, optimize the allocation of renewable energy resources, and design power grids that are resilient to climate change and natural hazards.
